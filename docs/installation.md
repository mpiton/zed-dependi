## From Zed Extensions (Recommended)

The easiest way to install Dependi:

1. Open Zed editor
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Linux/Windows)
3. Type "extensions" and select `zed: extensions`
4. Search for "Dependi"
5. Click **Install**

The extension automatically downloads and installs the language server for your platform.

## Manual Installation (Development)

For development or testing pre-release versions:

### Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.75+** (tested with 1.91.1)
- **wasm32-wasip1 target**: `rustup target add wasm32-wasip1`

### Build Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mpiton/zed-dependi.git
   cd zed-dependi
   ```

2. Build the LSP:
   ```bash
   cd dependi-lsp
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. Build the extension:
   ```bash
   cd ../dependi-zed
   cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip1
   ```

4. Install as dev extension in Zed:
   - Open Zed
   - Run command: `zed: install dev extension`
   - Select the `dependi-zed` directory

## Verify Installation

After installation, open any supported dependency file to verify Dependi is working:

1. Open a `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, or other dependency file
2. You should see inlay hints next to your dependencies showing version status
3. Hover over a dependency to see package information

If you don't see hints:
- Check if the extension is enabled in Zed's extensions panel
- View Zed logs for errors: run `zed --foreground` from terminal
- See [Troubleshooting]({% link troubleshooting.md %}) for common issues
