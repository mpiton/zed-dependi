## Overview

Code actions provide one-click updates for your dependencies. They understand semantic versioning and label updates so you can make informed decisions.

## Using Code Actions

### Trigger Code Actions

1. Place your cursor on a dependency line
2. Press `Cmd+.` (Mac) or `Ctrl+.` (Linux/Windows)
3. Select an update action from the menu

Alternatively, click the lightbulb icon that appears in the gutter.

### Available Actions

When an update is available, you'll see options like:

- `Update tokio to 1.36.0 (· patch)`
- `Update serde to 2.0.0 (⚠ MAJOR)`

## Semver Labels

Code actions include semver labels to help you understand the impact:

| Label | Meaning | Safety |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `⚠ MAJOR` | Breaking changes | Review changelog before updating |
| `+ minor` | New features, backwards compatible | Generally safe |
| `· patch` | Bug fixes only | Recommended |
| `* prerelease` | Experimental version | Use with caution |

### Major Updates

```
Update dependency to 2.0.0 (⚠ MAJOR)
```

Major updates may include breaking API changes. Always:
1. Read the changelog
2. Check migration guides
3. Test thoroughly after updating

### Minor Updates

```
Update dependency to 1.5.0 (+ minor)
```

Minor updates add features without breaking existing code. Generally safe to apply.

### Patch Updates

```
Update dependency to 1.4.3 (· patch)
```

Patch updates contain only bug fixes. These are the safest updates.

### Prerelease Updates

```
Update dependency to 2.0.0-beta.1 (* prerelease)
```

Prerelease versions are for testing new features. Not recommended for production.

## Bulk Updates

### Update All Dependencies

When multiple dependencies have updates available, a bulk action appears:

```
Update all dependencies (5 packages)
```

This updates all packages to their latest versions in one action.

{: .warning }
Bulk updates apply all changes at once. Review the changes carefully, especially for major version updates.

## Smart Defaults

Dependi prioritizes updates intelligently:

1. **Patch updates** are shown first (safest)
2. **Minor updates** are offered next
3. **Major updates** require explicit selection

This encourages safer update practices while still making major updates accessible.

## Version Constraints

Code actions respect your version constraint syntax:

| Original | Action | Result |
|----------|--------|--------|
| `"1.0.0"` | Update to 1.0.5 | `"1.0.5"` |
| `"^1.0.0"` | Update to 1.5.0 | `"^1.5.0"` |
| `"~1.0.0"` | Update to 1.0.5 | `"~1.0.5"` |
| `">=1.0"` | Update to 1.5.0 | `">=1.5.0"` |

## Workflow Tips

### Safe Update Strategy

1. Start with patch updates - they're low risk
2. Apply minor updates next
3. Handle major updates individually with testing

### CI Integration

After updating, run your CI pipeline to catch any issues:

```bash
# Run tests
cargo test

# Check for breaking changes
cargo clippy
```

### Lockfile Updates

After applying code actions, update your lockfile:

```bash
# Rust
cargo update

# Node.js
npm install

# Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Code Actions Appearing

1. Ensure cursor is on a dependency line
2. Check that the package has available updates
3. Verify inlay hints are showing (same data source)

### Action Not Applying

1. Check file is saved
2. Verify syntax is correct
3. Look for conflicting edits

### Wrong Version Suggested

1. Clear cache: `rm -rf ~/.cache/dependi/`
2. Restart Zed
3. Check if registry has newer version
